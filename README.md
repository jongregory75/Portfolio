# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Motivation

It's imperative that every software engineer maintains an accessible portfolio and general infomation about them.

This is my initial run at providing a static site with placeholders for new projects.

## Criteria
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
